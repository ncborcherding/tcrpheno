Description: The tcrpheno R package provides tools to predict T cell phenotypic fates based on their T cell receptor (TCR) sequences. Utilizing a logistic regression model trained on extensive paired TCR and transcriptome single-cell data, the primary function score_tcrs() analyzes input TCR alpha and/or beta chain information (CDR1/2/3 amino acid sequences, V/J gene usage) for individual cells. It calculates four scores, TCRinnate, TCR.8, TCRmem, and TCRreg, which quantify the predisposition of T cells towards innate-like, CD8+, memory, or regulatory phenotypes, respectively, by leveraging 1,250 biophysical features of the TCR sequence.
